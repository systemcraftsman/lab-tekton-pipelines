OpenShift Pipelines is a cloud-native, continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD)
solution for building pipelines using link:https://tekton.dev[Tekton]. Tekton is
a flexible, Kubernetes-native, open-source CI/CD framework that enables automating
deployments across multiple platforms (e.g. Kubernetes, serverless, VMs, etc) by
abstracting away the underlying details.

OpenShift Pipelines features:

* Standard CI/CD pipeline definition based on Tekton
* Build container images with tools such as link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.1/builds/understanding-image-builds.html#build-strategy-s2i_understanding-image-builds[Source-to-Image (S2I)] and link:https://buildah.io/[Buildah]
* Deploy applications to multiple platforms such as Kubernetes, serverless, and VMs
* Easy to extend and integrate with existing tools
* Scale pipelines on-demand
* Portable across any Kubernetes platform
* Designed for microservices and decentralized teams
* Integrated with the OpenShift Developer Console

This tutorial walks you through Tekton concepts and how to create and run a simple pipeline
for building and deploying a containerized app on OpenShift.

In this tutorial, you will do the following:

* Learn about Tekton concepts
* Install tasks
* Create a pipeline
* Add pipeline resources
* Trigger a pipelinerun
* Deploy a sample application on OpenShift from a pipelinerun
* Deploy the same application on another OpenShift cluster as *prod* that you will provision at IBM Cloud in the beginning of the workshop.
