In the previous section, you created three tasks called `s2i-nodejs`, `deploy` and `transfer-image`.
Before adding these to a pipeline, take a look at the definitions of these tasks
to understand how they work.

The `s2i-nodejs` has been broken into pieces below to help highlight its key aspects.

`s2i-nodejs` starts by defining a property called `inputs` as shown below. Underneath
`inputs`, there is a property called `resources` where it can be specified that a `type`
of `git` is required. This means that this task takes a git repository as an input.

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  inputs:
    resources:
      - name: source
        type: git
----

The `params` property below defines fields that must be specified when using the task
(e.g. the version of Node.js to use).

[source,yaml]
----
params:
  - name: VERSION
    description: The version of the nodejs
    default: '8'
  - name: PATH_CONTEXT
    description: The location of the path to run s2i from.
    default: .
  - name: TLSVERIFY
    description: Verify the TLS on the registry endpoint (for push/pull to a non-TLS registry)
    default: "true"
----

There is also an `outputs` property shown below that is used to specify that something
is output as a result of running this task. The `type` of the output is `image`.
This is to specify that this task creates an image from the git repository that
is sent in as an input.

[source,yaml]
----
outputs:
  resources:
    - name: image
      type: image
----

For each step of the task, a `steps` property is used to define what steps will
run during this task. Each step is denoted by its `name`. `s2i-nodejs` has three steps:

**generate**

[source,yaml]
----
- name: generate
  image: quay.io/openshift-pipeline/s2i
  workingdir: /workspace/source
  command: ['s2i', 'build', '$(inputs.params.PATH_CONTEXT)', 'registry.access.redhat.com/rhscl/nodejs-$(inputs.params.VERSION)-rhel7', '--as-dockerfile', '/gen-source/Dockerfile.gen']
  volumeMounts:
    - name: gen-source
      mountPath: /gen-source
  resources:
    limits:
      cpu: 500m
      memory: 1Gi
    requests:
      cpu: 500m
      memory: 1Gi
----

**build**

[source,yaml]
----
- name: build
  image: quay.io/buildah/stable
  workingdir: /gen-source
  command: ['buildah', 'bud', '--tls-verify=$(inputs.params.TLSVERIFY)', '--layers', '-f', '/gen-source/Dockerfile.gen', '-t', '$(outputs.resources.image.url)', '.']
  volumeMounts:
    - name: varlibcontainers
      mountPath: /var/lib/containers
    - name: gen-source
      mountPath: /gen-source
  resources:
    limits:
      cpu: 500m
      memory: 1Gi
    requests:
      cpu: 500m
      memory: 1Gi
  securityContext:
    privileged: true
----

**push**

[source,yaml]
----
- name: push
  image: quay.io/buildah/stable
  command: ['buildah', 'push', '--tls-verify=${inputs.params.TLSVERIFY}', '$(outputs.resources.image.url)', 'docker://$(outputs.resources.image.url)']
  volumeMounts:
    - name: varlibcontainers
      mountPath: /var/lib/containers
  resources:
    limits:
      cpu: 500m
      memory: 1Gi
    requests:
      cpu: 500m
      memory: 1Gi
  securityContext:
    privileged: true
----

Each step above runs in its own container. Since the `generate` step uses an s2i
command to generate a Dockerfile from the source code from the git repository input,
the image used for its container will have s2i installed.

The `build` and `push` steps both use a Buildah image to run commands to build the Dockerfile created by the
generate step and then push that image to an image registry (i.e., the output of the task).

You can see the images used for both these steps via the `image` property of each step.

The order of the steps above (i.e. 1. `generate` 2. `build` 3. `push`) is used to specify
when these steps should run. For `s2i-nodejs`, this means `generate` will run followed
by `build` and then the `push` step will execute last.

Under the `resources` property of each step, the amount of resources needed for the
container in terms of cpu and memory can be defined.

[source,yaml]
----
resources:
  limits:
    cpu: 500m
    memory: 1Gi
  requests:
    cpu: 500m
    memory: 1Gi
----

You can view the full definition of this task in the link:https://github.com/openshift/pipelines-catalog/blob/master/s2i-nodejs/s2i-nodejs-task.yaml[OpenShift Pipelines Catalog GitHub repository].

The `deploy` task created is much simpler as shown below:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Task
metadata:
  name: deploy
spec:
  inputs:
    params:
      - name: dc-name
        description: DeploymentConfig name to deploy
  steps:
    - name: deploy
      image: quay.io/openshiftlabs/openshift-cli-tekton-workshop:2.0
      command: ["/usr/local/bin/oc"]
      args:
        - "rollout latest $(inputs.params.dc-name)"
----

`deploy` doesn't have any inputs or outputs associated with it.
It also only has one step named `oc`.

This step uses an image with `oc` installed and runs the `oc` root command along with any
DeploymentConfig name passed to the step under the `dc-name` property. This `task` allows you to deploy the image created by the `s2i-nodejs`
task to OpenShift. You will see how this takes place in the next section.

And we have the `transfer-image` task that uses `skopeo` to transfer image from one registry to another:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Task
metadata:
  name: transfer-image
spec:
  inputs:
    resources:
      - name: image
        type: image
    params:
      - name: TLSVERIFY
        description: Verify the TLS on the registry endpoint (for push/pull to a non-TLS registry)
        default: "false"
  outputs:
    resources:
      - name: image
        type: image
  steps:
    - name: transfer
      image: quay.io/rhpipeline/skopeo:alpine
      command:
        [
          "skopeo",
          "copy",
          "--src-tls-verify=$(inputs.params.TLSVERIFY)",
          "--dest-tls-verify=$(inputs.params.TLSVERIFY)",
          "--dest-creds=${EXTERNAL_IMAGE_REGISTRY_USER_NAME}:${EXTERNAL_IMAGE_REGISTRY_PASSWORD}",
          "docker://$(inputs.resources.image.url)",
          "docker://$(outputs.resources.image.url)",
        ]
      resources:
        limits:
          cpu: 500m
          memory: 1Gi
        requests:
          cpu: 500m
          memory: 1Gi
      securityContext:
        privileged: true

----

In this case we will use `transfer-image` task to transfer the image from OpenShift internal registry to your external registry you setup before.

In the next section, you will create a pipeline that uses the `s2i-nodejs`, `deploy` and `transfer-image` tasks. Click Continue to move to the next section.
