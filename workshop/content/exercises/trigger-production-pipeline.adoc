Now, since everything is ready, it is time to trigger the deployment to production. As you can recall we can either create a PipelineRun instance, or use `tkn` command line interface which is recommended in this case. 

Run the pipeline by setting the relevant resources as follows:

[source,bash,role=execute-1]
----
tkn pipeline start prod-deploy-pipeline \
        -r prod-cluster=prod-cluster \
        -r app-external-image=nodejs-ex-external-image \
        -s pipeline
----

Apart from the console logs, as you may recall you can also check the pipeline run from the `non-prod` cluster console on the right-hand side:

While the pipeline is running check the overview page of your `prod` cluster. You can see the deployment is started:

After waiting a couple of seconds you can see that it is successfully deployed:

For verifying the application running on the cluster click on the route link under **Routes - External Traffic** title:

*Congratulations!* You have successfully deployed your application on another cluster just by promoting the image using Tekton/OpenShift Pipelines.
