Before starting to this workshop you have to setup some environment variables due to the you have set up and *prod* OpenShift cluster you have on IBM Cloud.

First open the `env-vars.sh` file with `vi` and set the information you get for your `EXTERNAL_IMAGE_REGISTRY_PASSWORD`, `PROD_CLUSTER_URL` and `PROD_CLUSTER_TOKEN`.

[source,bash,role=execute-1]
----
vi exercise/env-vars.sh
----

Fill in the relevant areas:

[source,bash]
----
export EXTERNAL_IMAGE_REGISTRY_PASSWORD=[IBM REGISTRY TOKEN]
export PROD_CLUSTER_URL=[IBM CLOUD OPENSHIFT URL]
export PROD_CLUSTER_TOKEN=[IBM CLOUD OPENSHIFT TOKEN]
----

Save the file with a `:wq!` and exit.

Now you can run the `setup-environment.sh` file for setting up the environment.

[source,bash,role=execute-1]
----
chmod a+x exercise/setup-environment.sh && ./exercise/setup-environment.sh
----

Make sure that the script runs without any errors. 

Now we can continue with deploying the sample application. Clear your terminal before continuing:

[source,bash,role=execute-1]
----
clear
----
