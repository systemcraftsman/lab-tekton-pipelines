Before we can trigger the pipeline just created, pipeline resources must be
defined as inputs and outputs for the `build` task of the pipeline.

The `build` task of your pipeline takes a git repository as an input and then
produces an image that is pushed to an image registry. Pipeline resources are how
you can specify the specific urls of the git repository and the image registry.

Much like tasks, these pipeline resources are reusable. The git repository pipeline resource
could be used as an input to a different task on a different pipeline, and the
image registry output could be used for a different image as the result of a task run.

The following pipeline resource defines the git repository and reference for the `nodejs-ex` application:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1alpha1
kind: PipelineResource
metadata:
  name: nodejs-ex-git
spec:
  type: git
  params:
  - name: url
    value: https://github.com/sclorg/nodejs-ex
----

You can see above that the resource has a name (i.e. `nodejs-ex-git`), and, under
the `spec` property, we define that this pipeline resource has a type of `git`, meaning
it is a git repository.

The `type` of a pipeline resource corresponds to a list a valid options for pipeline resources.
These valid options include:

* `git` - indicates a pipeline resource is a GitHub repository
* `image` - indicates a pipeline resource is a container image
* `storage` - indicates a pipeline resource is a storage blob resource
* `cluster` - indicates a pipeline resource is a Kubernetes cluster image
* `pullRequest` - indicates a pipeline resource is an SCM pull request
* `cloudEvent` - indicates a pipeline resource is a cloud event URI

There will be more valid types added to the Tekton API moving forward, but you will
only need to focus on the `git` and `image` types for this workshop.

The last property of `nodejs-ex-git` is `params`, which can be used to specify
the url associated with the git input.

The following defines the OpenShift internal registry for the resulting `nodejs-ex`
image to be pushed to:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1alpha1
kind: PipelineResource
metadata:
  name: nodejs-ex-image
  labels:
    app: tekton-workshop
spec:
  type: image
  params:
  - name: url
    value: ${OPENSHIFT_IMAGE_REGISTRY}/${PROJECT_NAMESPACE}/nodejs-ex
----

The format follows the same structure as the git pipeline resource. The main difference
is that a type of `image` is specified under the `spec` property, meaning this is an
image registry that will have an image pushed to it. The url for the registry is
specified under the `params` property just like with the git pipeline resource.

The following defines the OpenShift external registry for the deployed `nodejs-ex` image:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1alpha1
kind: PipelineResource
metadata:
  name: nodejs-ex-external-image
  labels:
    app: tekton-workshop
spec:
  type: image
  params:
    - name: url
      value: ${EXTERNAL_IMAGE_REGISTRY}/${PROJECT_NAMESPACE}/nodejs-ex
----

Create the above pipeline resources via the `oc` commands below.

Add the git repository input for the pipeline:

[source,bash,role=execute-1]
----
oc create -f exercise/git-pipeline-resource.yaml
----

Add the registry for the image to be pushed to as an output of the `build` task
of the pipeline:

[source,bash,role=execute-1]
----
oc create -f exercise/image-pipeline-resource.yaml
----

Add the external registry for the image to be transfered to as an output of the `transfer-image` task
of the pipeline:

[source,bash,role=execute-1]
----
oc create -f exercise/external-image-pipeline-resource.yaml
----


You can see the pipeline resources created using `tkn`:

[source,bash,role=execute-1]
----
tkn resource ls
----

You can also get more information about the pipeline resources in your OpenShift project
using the command below. Run the command below to see information about the `nodejs-ex-git`
pipeline resource:

[source,bash,role=execute-1]
----
tkn resource describe nodejs-ex-git
----

You should see the `Name` of the pipeline resource, the `Namespace` (i.e. your OpenShift project)
it has been created in, and a `PipelineResource Type` of `git` to specify this is a git repository.

It also shows the url of the git repository you will use under the `Params` section
of the output. You will also notice a section of the output called `Secret Params`. These
secret params are how you can mask sensitive information associated with pipeline resources,
such as a password or key.

You can also describe the `nodejs-ex-image` pipeline resource by running the command below:

[source,bash,role=execute-1]
----
tkn resource describe nodejs-ex-image
----

The major difference you should notice is that `nodejs-ex-image` is of `PipelineResource Type`
`image`. You should also notice the OpenShift image registry url that is specific to the
OpenShift project you are working in.

Now that pipeline resources have been specified, you can include these as part
of a pipeline run that will deploy the `nodejs-ex` application out to OpenShift.
Clear your terminal before continuing:

[source,bash,role=execute-1]
----
clear
