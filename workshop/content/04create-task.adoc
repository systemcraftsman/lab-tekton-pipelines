Tasks consist of a number of steps that are executed sequentially. Each step is
executed in a separate container within the same task pod. Tasks can have inputs
and outputs in order to interact with other tasks as part of a pipeline.

By hosting each step of a task in its own container, you can package all the tools
that are needed for a particular step in the container image used by the step. Using OpenShift,
these containers can be very easily created and deleted, so they only run when they are needed
(i.e. during a CI/CD pipeline run).

Here is an example of a Maven task for building a Maven-based Java application:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Task
metadata:
  name: maven-build
spec:
  inputs:
    resources:
    - name: workspace-git
      targetPath: /
      type: git
  steps:
  - name: build
    image: maven:3.6.0-jdk-8-slim
    command:
    - /usr/bin/mvn
    args:
    - install
----

When a task starts running, it starts a pod and runs each step sequentially in
a separate container in the same pod. The task above happens to have a single step,
but tasks can have multiple steps. Since these steps run within the same pod,
they have access to the same volumes in order to cache files, access configmaps,
secrets, etc. Tasks can also receive inputs (e.g. a git repository) and produce
outputs (e.g. an image in a registry) in order to interact with each other.

For each step as part of a task, an image is declared that will be used to host
the step as it executes. In the example above, the image specified is `maven:3.6.0-jdk-8-slim`.
The `maven:3.6.0-jdk-8-slim` image allows the step to run in a container a that provides
necessary libraries to run a `mvn install` command to add an artifact to a local repository.

Only the requirement for a git repository is declared on the task under the `inputs:` property
above and not a specific git repository to be used. This allows tasks to be reusable for multiple
pipelines and purposes. You can find more examples of reusable tasks in the link:https://github.com/tektoncd/catalog[Tekton Catalog]
and link:https://github.com/openshift/pipelines-catalog[OpenShift Catalog] repositories.

Now that you understand the concept of a task, you should create the `s2i-nodejs`
and `deploy` tasks from the catalog repositories using `oc`. These will
be the tasks you add to your pipeline for this workshop.

Create the `s2i-nodejs` task that will define and build a container image for the
`nodejs-ex` application and push the resulting image to an image registry:

[source,bash,role=execute-1]
----
oc create -f tektontasks/s2i-nodejs-task.yaml
----

Create the `deploy` task that will deploy the image created by `s2i-nodejs`
as a container on OpenShift:

[source,bash,role=execute-1]
----
oc create -f tektontasks/deploy-task.yaml
----

Create the `transfer-image` task that will transfer the deployed image to your external registry, for deploying your *prod* cluster later.

[source,bash,role=execute-1]
----
oc create -f tektontasks/transfer-image-task.yaml
----

**NOTE**: For convenience, the tasks have been copied from their original locations
in the Tekton and OpenShift catalog git repositories to the workshop.

You can take a look at the list of tasks using the link:https://github.com/tektoncd/cli[Tekton CLI] (`tkn`):

[source,bash,role=execute-1]
----
tkn task ls
----

You should see similar output to this:

[source,bash]
----
NAME               AGE
deploy   58 seconds ago
s2i-nodejs         1 minute ago
transfer-image   3 seconds ago
----

In the next section, you will examine the task definitions you just created to
gain a better understanding of the pipeline you will create. Clear your terminal
before continuing:

[source,bash,role=execute-1]
----
clear
