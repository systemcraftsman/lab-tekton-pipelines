= IBM Cloud Prerequisites

Before starting to workshop, you need to sign up to IBM Cloud to receive an OpenShift cluster and to create an external private container registry. 

This section describes how you can create an IBM Cloud Account, how to create an external private container registry and how you are going to claim an OpenShift Cluster for this workshop.

* <<Create An External Private Container Registry>>
* <<Create API Key to access your private registry>>
* <<Claim your OpenShift Cluster for the workshop>>

== Creating an IBM Cloud Account

If you didn't create your IBM Cloud account before the workshop, follow this section to create it. Otherwise, you can skip to the next section - <<Create An External Private Container Registry>>
.

. To create an IBM Cloud Account, go to the link that your workshop host provides you. For example *ibm.biz/xxx*

== Create An External Private Container Registry

In this section, we will create a private container registry to deploy our built container images.

. First, we need to be sure that we are on our personal account.

. Click to "*Create*" button which locates on top right of the page or at the bottom right of the page.

. In your container registry page:

.. Be sure that "*Dallas*" is selected as _Location_
.. Click to "*Namespaces*" tab
.. Click to "Create namespace+" button.
.. Enter your registry namespace as follows "*workshop-userX*". (X will be given to you by workshop hosts.)

. After creating your registry namespace, you should see similar something as below:
image:./images/ibmcloud/registry-namespace-list.png[IBM Cloud Container Registry Namespace List Page]

Congratulations! You have created an external private container registry.

Your registry url is as follows: *us.icr.io/workshop-userX*

== Create API Key to access your private registry

There are three ways to access our container registry. 

. ibmcloud command line tool
. global api key
. service id

The most secure way to do is to use service id way. Below, we are describing how to create a service id and a key associated to it. You can read more details from link:https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/Registry?topic=registry-registry_access[IBM Cloud Container Registry documentation.,window=_blank]

. Click to *Manage* dropdown. Select *Access (IAM)* item from the menu.
image:./images/ibmcloud/access-iam.png[IBM Cloud Account Access IAM Page]

. Click to *Services IDs* item on the left menu.

. Click "Create +" button. Give a name and a description to your service id. For Ex: 
* Name: Container Registry External Access
* Description: This service id is to access private registry from ci/cd tools or from an external third party tool.

. Click to *Access Policies* tab and then click *Assign Access +* button to assign a service to this id.

. Fill the fields as showed below in the screen shot:
image:./images/ibmcloud/create-service-id.png[IBM Cloud Create Service ID Page]

. Once your policy is created, click on the *API Keys tab*. Then click *Create +* button.
* Name: Container Registry External Access Key
* Description: This key is intended to be used by third party applications to access container registry service.

. Click to *Download* button to download your key as a JSON to your computer. Your key will be similar as follows:

[source,json]
----
{
  "name": "Container Registry External Access Key",
  "description": "This key is intended to be used by third party applications to access container registry service.",
  "createdAt": "2020-02-20T15:46+0000",
  "apikey": "xxxxx"
}
----

Congratulations! Now you can access to your private registry from any docker host using:

[source,bash]
----
docker login -u iamapikey -p <your_apikey> us.icr.io/<your-namespace>
----

  P.S. iamapikey must be the user name.
