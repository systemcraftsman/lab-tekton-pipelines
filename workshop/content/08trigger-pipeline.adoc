Now that you have created tasks, a pipeline, and pipeline resources,
you are ready to trigger a pipeline that will deploy the `nodejs-ex` application
out to OpenShift.

As mentioned earlier, a `PipelineRun` is the custom resource used to trigger a
pipeline. In this exercise, you will create a `PipelineRun` via `tkn` to deploy
the `nodejs-ex` application out to OpenShift.

The `PipelineRun` definition below is how you can trigger a pipeline and tie
it to the git and image resources that are used for this specific invocation:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1alpha1
kind: PipelineRun
metadata:
  generateName: deploy-pipelinerun-
spec:
  pipelineRef:
    name: deploy-pipeline
  trigger:
    type: manual
  serviceAccount: 'pipeline'
  resources:
  - name: app-git
    resourceRef:
      name: nodejs-ex-git
  - name: app-image
    resourceRef:
      name: nodejs-ex-image
  - name: app-external-image
    resourceRef:
      name: nodejs-ex-external-image
----

Under the `spec` property, you'll see the `pipelineRef` property where the pipeline
to be used is specified. You should see the name of the pipeline you created (i.e. `deploy-pipeline`).

The last property of the `PipelineRun` of note is `resources`. This is how the specific
git repository and image registry urls can be entered for the `PipelineRun`. You'll
see the pipeline resource references you just created in the `PipelineRun` definition.

While learning about the resource definition behind a pipeline run is important,
you do not have to define this resource yourself to trigger a pipeline run. You
can create the above `PipelineRun` to deploy the `nodejs-ex` application out to OpenShift via
`tkn`.

The `tkn` command below triggers a pipeline run. The `-r` flag allows you specify
what pipeline resources will be included in a pipeline run. You can see the git and image
pipeline resources you created earlier.

You will also notice the `-s` flag for specifying a service account. This is how you
can add your `pipeline` service account to the pipeline run.

Run the command below to kick off the pipeline run:

[source,bash,role=execute-1]
----
tkn pipeline start deploy-pipeline \
        -r app-git=nodejs-ex-git \
        -r app-image=nodejs-ex-image \
        -r app-external-image=nodejs-ex-external-image \
        -s pipeline
----

After running the command above, the pipeline you created earlier is now running
and a number of pods are created to execute the tasks that are defined as part of the
pipeline. After 4-5 minutes, the pipeline run should finish successfully.

Additionally, you will begin to see the pipeline run logs immediately after the pod
for the first task is done initializing.

Before continuing, grab the name of the pipeline run and save it to an environment
variable so you can learn more about the pipeline run later in this workshop:

[source,bash,role=execute-2]
----
RUN=`tkn pr ls -o jsonpath='{$.items[?(@.status.conditions[0].reason=="Running")].metadata.name}' | tr ' ' '\n' | head -1`; echo $RUN
----

To view the pipeline run created, run the following `tkn` command:

[source,bash,role=execute-2]
----
tkn pr ls
----

You should see the `NAME` of your pipeline run, the pipeline run start time (i.e. `STARTED`),
and the `STATUS` as `Running`.

As mentioned earlier, when a task is running as part of a pipeline, it allocates
a pod that will host steps that each run in a separate container. You can see
the pod for the first task on your pipeline (i.e. `build`) by running the following
command:

[source,bash,role=execute-2]
----
watch oc get pods
----

You should see a pod with a name consisting of `deploy-pipeline-run` and `build`.
When `build` finishes, another pod will be allocated to host the step of the `deploy`
task of your pipeline. After `deploy` finishes you will see the nodejs-ex application pod as well.

Tekton CLI Logs
---------------

The logs output tells you what tasks are running as well as what step it is running.
You'll see the output structured as `[task_name : step_name]`. An example from this
pipeline run is below for the `generate` step of the `build` task:

[source,bash]
----
[build : generate]
----

As these logs come in via `tkn`, you can see output from the task-step combinations from the `build` task:

[source,bash]
----
[build : generate]
[build : build]
[build : push]
----

See the output of the `deploy` task execution:

[source,bash]
----
[deploy : deploy]
----

Upon the successful completion of the pipeline run, you will see the following output from the logs:

[source,bash]
----
[deploy : deploy] deploymentconfig.apps.openshift.io/nodejs-ex rolled out
----

You can also eventually see the output of the `transfer` task execution with its one step:

[source,bash]
----
[transfer : transfer]
----

While the pipeline run is executing, you can take a look at how you can visualize
a pipeline run through the OpenShift web console in the next section. Leave the logs
running so that you can confirm the successful deployment and image transfer message when the pipeline run
finishes.

To check the transfered image, just go to the :

image:../images/ibm-image-repository-check-image.png[Check Image Repository]

Clear the terminal without the running logs before continuing:
[source,bash,role=execute-2]
----
clear
